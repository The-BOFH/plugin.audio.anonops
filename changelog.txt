1.5.0
Server Sided Station/Archive/Video list, Should Anonops ever decide 
to host part of or the whole addon they would be able to have full 
control of what station and who is in the archive,etc, they could even 
get real creative and give the DJ's the ability to edit their archive 
without giving them access to an anonops backend. 




Added in a Archive Section! This will be further expanded on once I figure out a Viable method for archiving them.


MixCloud and other Services are using cloudflare and or other WAF 
software that makes hotlinking to the direct file impossibile with kodi


I have a Proposed Solution for this,


I could host the archives of the shows on cdn.basedsec.pro


I have No Problem hosting Archives of RadioShows but some may consider this a conflict of interest.


An alternative is if the dj provide his own hosting then the files could be hotlinked there.


Another could be let anonops host it (unlikely)


If we can find a host that we can upload mp3/m4a and hotlink to it then that could work.


Im opting to host archives on my cdn because i want to provide a 
stable host and dont want an addon that points to a bunch of 404'd links
